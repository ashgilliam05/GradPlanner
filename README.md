# GradPlanner
WGU - TXP1 - Project in Introduction to Programming

 Students will utilize this application to input the number of credit units (CUs) remaining in their degree (must be greater than 0)
    and the number of CUs they plan to complete each term (Must be 12 of greater).  Based on student input, the application will determine the
    number of CUs remaining to graduate, how many terms it will take to graduate, how many months it will take to graduate, and the cost of tuition
    based on terms remaining.
